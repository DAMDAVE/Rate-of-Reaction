            <p>Many parameters can be used to measure Rate of Reaction, there are a couple number of them;</p><hr>
            <li>Concentration</li><hr>
            <li>Mass</li><hr>
            <li>Volume</li><hr>
            <li>Precipitate Formed</li><hr>
            <li>PH Changes</li><hr>
            <li>Colour intensity</li><hr>
            <li>Total Gas Pressure</li><hr>
            <li>Volume of Gaseous product</li><hr>
            <Li>E . T . C</Li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="container last-div">
        <P>Any of these parameters can form a basis for the calculation of the rate of reaction, simply put; <em style="color: white;">Change in any of these params with respect to time is a totally legal definition of rate of reaction</em><br>
        Now, did we not say otherwise in the previous page. <br>
        Ummm, not really. Those defined are just so much as two out of the many numerous explanations or definitions for it but for exam sake , You'll be absolutely fine with those two<br>
        But what do I mean by what is written in italic? Well, let's take concentration as an example<br>
        We can say; Rate is the change of concentration of rectant and product with respect to time<br> or if it is mass, we can say Rate is the change of mass of reactant and product with respect to time.<br><br>
        That wasn't too hard to understand, was it. You might be neeeding some water, at the point where i was typing this, my brain was at boiling point tooðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜ª
