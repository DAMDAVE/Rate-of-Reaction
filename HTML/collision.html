   <div class="meaning-div container-fluid div">
         <p class="text-left pcol">Sounds Interesting Right<br>
         So what's this Advertised Collision Theory;<br>
         In no ambiguous words, The collision Theorem states that for Reactions to occur, there muct be effective collisions between the particles of the reactant.
         In other words, Without effective collisions, no reactions can occur.<br>
         So what's ;<br>
        Collision<br>
        Effective or Fruitful Collision and<br>
        Uneffective or Unfruitful Collision
         </p>
         </div>
    <div class="container-fluid div div2">
        <img src="../Images/Collision.jpg">
        <p class="pcol">We'll be using the picture above to discuss a bit on what the collision theory is<br><br>
            So let's start with collision itself;
            <p class="pcol">Collision as the name implies means when two things collide together but in this respect, we'll be seeing how that applies to chemical reactions<br>In a chemical Reaction, A collision is said to happen when two atoms or particles collide with one another. Now without this collision, no reaction can take place. And even after the collision, the reaction isn't guaranteed yet as we shall see</p>
            <P class="pcol">So I did say the reaction isn't guaranteed yet, that's right and why is that, its because at times, we have uneffective collisions i.e collisions that don't make atoms or molecules form new ones.<br>
            Now what about the effective Collisions, when two molecules collide effectively, they give rise to a new product<br><br>
            I'd figured out there'd be no way to explain it just verbally so I put that picture there for you, go through it and you should get a sense of why collisions might be effective at times and at times not be.</P>
            <P class="pcol"> Alternatively, for those of us who know what a jigsaw puzzle is. There has to be a part that fixes into another perfectly. If you try to fit the wrong piece, it won't work. When it works, that's an effective collision. When it doesn't...well, you know what it is</P>
            <p class="pcol">There are a two factors that must be fulfilled before an effective collision can occur...its pretty much not a random process
                <br><br> 1. The particles must be properly aligned or orientated like that picture showed<br>
                2. The particles must also posess the minimum kinetic energy for the reaction to occur<br><br>
                We've pretty much seen what it means for the particles to be properly oriented but which one be this minimum kinetic energy again...e choke abi<br>
                Look below you, the next subheading explains that
            </p>

    <div class="container-fluid div div3">
        <h1 class="text-center">Activation Energy</h1>
        <br>
        <hr class="hp">
        <p class="pcol">Na the dude be this...hin name na activation energy. <br>
        Without wasting much of your time...I'd like to go straight to what it means<hr>
        <p class="pcol"><em>The minimum amount of energy a particle must possess for a collison to be effective is called activation energy E<sub>a</sub></em>
        </p>
        </p>
        <p class="pcol">
            Activation Energy can be likened to a barrier that must be overcome before a reaction can occur<br>
            Sadly tho, number of particles having this energy at normal temperature are usually few, many reactions are therefore slow because of that
        </p>
        <img src="../Images/Activation.jpg">
        <p class="pcol">The reaction above is a profile for an endothermic reaction, we also have Exothermic reactions. Your assignment would be to find out more on that...me sef don try😁😪<br>
        Oya make we move to next page sharp...I hope say the thing never boring🤯</p>
